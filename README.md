# TO DO LIST 

This is not only my first attempt at making a 'to do (...or not to do)' list, but also my first project that I did completely from scratch in general. I made it to test the skills I've learned so far from various online courses and 'beginner friendly' articles.

## Description:
A very simple /to do list/ where you can add, delete and edit your tasks as well as check them as done. Additional notifications about empty list or warning if there is an attempt to add a blank task.

Eveyrthing done using CSS and basic JavaScript. In the future I'll try to write it in a diffrent way, because I'm sure there is a more efficient and cleaner way to code it.

## Credits:
Most infromation required to build this project I got from:

https://websamuraj.pl/ (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript basics)

and

https://mmcschool.pl/kursy/kurs-javascript.html (also JavaScript basics)

**both platforms are in Polish
